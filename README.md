# REST Web Service JAX-RS and Arduino client
This is just an practical example of a client-server weather app. The server is a Java REST API created with Jersey and embedded Jetty. It uses Security Constraints and Authorization Constraint to drive the authentication and authorization operations of web container security. 
The web container authenticate the Arduino web client/user using HTTP DIGEST.
